# Four Kingdom Content Pack - Names, Royals, Townsfolk, Paths, Enemies, Keys

Purpose: lock a single playable content set for the active four-kingdom restoration arc.

Canon alignment:
- Kingdom IDs and progression order follow `packages/client/src/data/KingdomNamingSystem.ts` and `packages/client/src/systems/KingdomRestorationArc.ts`.
- This pack is content-forward and can be used by quest, dialogue, and encounter systems.

## Arc Scope

1. Aldermarch
2. Stormrage
3. Vastmalaise
4. Sunward

## Canon Naming Lock

- The 4th starter kingdom is canonically named `Sunward` for maps, progression IDs, and key systems.
- `Solmere` is retained as an in-world cultural/ancestral alias tied to House Solthane lines.

## Awakened Human Element Path Mapping (Lore Canon)

Use this mapping for awakened human origin stories and NPC callouts:

1. Earth/Water awakened lean -> Aldermarch path
2. Storm awakened lean -> Stormrage path
3. Shadow/Arcane awakened lean -> Vastmalaise path
4. Fire/Light awakened lean -> Sunward path

### Canon Distinction: Awakened vs Hero

- Awakened person: human with elemental resonance, not automatically a combatant.
- Hero: awakened person who trains with gear, weapons, field discipline, and kingdom certification.
- Town and kingdom populations include both combat and non-combat awakened roles.

## Shared Enemy Families (Allowed Across Every Kingdom)

These can appear in all abandoned structures and castle clearings with palette/stat variants.

- Gloom Rats (swarm melee)
- Rift Bats (air harass)
- Hollow Hounds (pack rush)
- Broken Wardens (fallen armored guards)
- Ash Witches (debuff casters)
- Vinebound Revenants (grapplers)
- Shard Slingers (ranged)
- Gate Leeches (portal parasites)

Use this baseline split for normal clears:
- 30% swarm (rats/bats)
- 30% melee pressure (hounds/wardens)
- 25% ranged control (slingers/witches)
- 15% utility/portal hazards (leeches/revenants)

## Shared Castle-Clearing Elite Set

Use these in each kingdom's keep/citadel clear before throne boss.

- Crownless Knight Captain (elite duel unit)
- Rift Standard Bearer (buff to nearby enemies)
- Gatebinder Monk (locks movement lanes)
- Vault Devourer (slow tank, high stagger)

## Quest Key System (People Keys and Royal Keys)

### Key Types

- House Keys: unlock homes, workshops, and personal storerooms
- Trade Keys: unlock shop floors, cellar cages, back-office chests
- Gate Sigils: unlock district gates and route barricades
- Archive Seals: unlock lore rooms, map rooms, old records
- Royal Keys (one per kingdom): unlock inner keep portal/royal vault door

### Universal Key Rules

- Every key is tied to one named NPC owner or steward.
- Lost-key quests always require at least one clue scene and one combat or traversal beat.
- Royal Key cannot be traded, only entrusted by a royal bloodline member, regent, or sworn keykeeper.
- Portal doors require both: local Royal Key + one restored district condition.

## Implementation Mapping Notes

Suggested integration targets:
- Dialogue and NPC roster data: `packages/client/src/data/*Roster*.ts`
- Quest chain states and IDs: `packages/shared/src/quests.ts`
- Encounter content pass: `packages/server/src/content/bosses.ts`
- Kingdom progression hook points: `packages/client/src/systems/KingdomRestorationArc.ts`

This file intentionally pins names and role ownership so quest scripting can proceed without renaming churn.
