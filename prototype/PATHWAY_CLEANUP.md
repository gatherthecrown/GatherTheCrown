# Pathway and Object Cleanup

## What Changed

### Pathways - Much Cleaner!

**Cobblestone Cross (+)**
- ONE horizontal road through center (2 tiles wide)
- ONE vertical road through center (2 tiles wide)
- Clean intersection in the middle
- No scattered tiles

**Brick X Diagonal**
- ONE diagonal from top-left to bottom-right
- ONE diagonal from top-right to bottom-left
- Single tile width for each diagonal
- Forms a clean X shape

### Object Placement - More Spacious!

**Trees:**
- Reduced from 20 to 15 regular trees
- Reduced berry trees to 12 (from 10-15 random)
- Increased spacing from 120 to 180 pixels
- Larger buffer from pathways (120 pixels)
- Better distribution

**Bushes:**
- Reduced from 25 to 18
- Increased spacing from 90 to 130 pixels
- Larger pathway buffer (100 pixels)
- More breathing room

### Visual Result

**Before:**
- Scattered pathway tiles everywhere
- Cluttered forest
- Objects too close together
- Hard to see paths clearly

**After:**
- Clean + and X pattern
- Open, spacious forest
- Clear pathways
- Easy navigation
- Professional look

## Technical Improvements

**Better Collision Detection:**
- More accurate diagonal distance calculation
- Larger buffers around pathways
- Improved spacing algorithm

**Cleaner Generation:**
- Single-pass pathway creation
- No duplicate tiles
- Consistent spacing
- Predictable layout

## Navigation

The new layout makes it easy to navigate:
- Follow cobblestone for main roads
- Follow brick for diagonal shortcuts
- Plenty of space between objects
- Clear sight lines

## Performance

Fewer objects = better performance:
- 15 regular trees (was 20)
- 12 berry trees (was 10-15)
- 18 bushes (was 25)
- Total: 45 objects (was 50-60)

Still plenty of content, but much cleaner!
