# Combat System Test Guide

## What Was Fixed

1. **Movement During Attack**: Hero now stops moving when attacking (left-click)
2. **Damage Detection**: Enemies take damage when hit by player attacks
3. **Visual Feedback**: Enemies flash white when damaged
4. **Hit Tracking**: Each attack can only hit each enemy once

## How to Test

1. Launch the game using `PLAY_PROTOTYPE.bat`
2. Move close to an enemy (red sprite)
3. Left-click to attack
4. Watch the console output for debug messages
5. Verify:
   - Hero stops moving during attack animation
   - Red attack range circle appears
   - Enemy flashes white when hit
   - Enemy health bar decreases
   - Console shows "Hit [enemy] for 20 damage!"
   - Enemy dies and drops gold when health reaches 0

## Debug Output

The game now prints debug messages to the console:
- "Player attacking! Range: 50, Damage: 20" - when you left-click
- "Hit [enemy type] for 20 damage! HP: [current]/[max]" - when you hit an enemy

## Expected Behavior

- Attack range: 50 pixels (shown as red circle)
- Attack damage: 20 HP per hit
- Attack cooldown: 0.5 seconds
- Stamina cost: 5 per attack
- Basic enemies: 50 HP (3 hits to kill)
- Mini-boss: 200 HP (10 hits to kill)

## Known Issues

If enemies are not taking damage:
1. Make sure you're close enough (within 50 pixels)
2. Check console for debug messages
3. Verify the red attack circle overlaps the enemy sprite
