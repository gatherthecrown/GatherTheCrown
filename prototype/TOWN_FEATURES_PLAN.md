## Layout Strategy

**Block Usage:**
- Corner blocks: Houses with yards
- Center block: Town square with well/fountain
- Edge blocks: Inn, Shop, more houses
- Between paths: Small decorative elements

**Placement Rules:**
- Buildings face roads
- Lawns behind/beside houses
- Wells in accessible areas
- Ponds in quieter corners
- Keep some natural forest areas

## Color Palette

**Buildings:**
- Houses: Browns, grays, reds (roofs)
- Inn: Warm browns, yellow windows
- Shop: Bright colors, awning stripes

**Nature:**
- Lawns: Lighter green (#60, 160, 60)
- Ponds: Blue (#80, 150, 220)
- Flowers: Reds, yellows, pinks, purples

**Details:**
- Fences: Brown wood (#120, 80, 50)
- Lamps: Dark wood + yellow glow
- Signs: Wood with painted text

## Implementation Order

1. **First Pass** (After you review roads):
   - Create house sprites (2-3 styles)
   - Create inn sprite
   - Create shop sprite
   - Place buildings in blocks

2. **Second Pass**:
   - Add wells (1-2)
   - Add lawn patches around houses
   - Add ponds (1-2)

3. **Third Pass**:
   - Decorative elements (fences, flowers)
   - Street lamps
   - Signs

4. **Polish**:
   - Particle effects (smoke, water ripples)
   - Lighting effects
   - Shadows

## Notes

- Keep pathways clear
- Buildings should have clear entrances facing roads
- Balance natural (trees) with urban (buildings)
- Leave some open spaces
- Make it feel lived-in but not cluttered

Ready to implement once you've reviewed the current road layout!
