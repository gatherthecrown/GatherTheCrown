# Berry Trees and Pathways Update

## New Features Added

### Berry Trees
Berry trees now spawn based on your Creat's element type! Each element has unique colored foliage and glowing berries:

- **Fire** (current): Red/orange foliage with bright orange glowing berries
- **Water**: Blue foliage with cyan glowing berries
- **Earth**: Green/brown foliage with bronze glowing berries
- **Storm**: Purple-gray foliage with white-blue glowing berries
- **Light**: Yellow-white foliage with bright yellow glowing berries
- **Shadow**: Dark purple foliage with violet glowing berries

10-15 berry trees spawn randomly throughout the world matching your Fire Drake's element.

### Pathways

Two types of paths now crisscross the world:

**Cobblestone Paths (Main Roads)**
- Gray stone tiles with irregular cobblestone pattern
- Form the main roads through the center of the map
- Horizontal and vertical roads intersect in the middle
- Weathered appearance with mortar lines

**Brick Paths (Side Paths)**
- Reddish-brown brick tiles in offset pattern
- Smaller paths connecting corners to the center
- Diagonal routes from each corner
- Classic brick laying pattern with mortar

### Visual Hierarchy

The rendering order ensures proper layering:
1. Background color (forest green)
2. Grid (reference)
3. **Pathways** (ground layer)
4. Grass tufts
5. Bushes
6. Fragments/items
7. Enemies
8. Creat companion
9. Player
10. Regular trees
11. **Berry trees** (foreground)
12. UI overlay

### How It Works

- Berry trees are generated when the game starts based on `self.creat.element`
- If you change the creat's element in the code, the berry trees will match
- Pathways are procedurally placed to create a road network
- All sprites are 64x64 or 80x80 for consistency

### Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
- Berry collection mechanic (restore health/stamina)
- Different berry effects per element
- Path-based enemy spawning
- Towns/villages at path intersections
- Dynamic element switching (change berry tree types)

### Testing

Run the game and explore to see:
- Fire element berry trees with glowing orange berries
- Cobblestone main roads (gray)
- Brick side paths (reddish-brown)
- Proper layering of all elements

The world now feels more alive with varied vegetation and clear pathways to follow!
