## Visibility Notes

- **Creat visibility** can be toggled (set `creat.visible = False` for tutorial mode)
- **Grid lines** are subtle reference lines (can be disabled)
- **Glow effects** on collectibles make them easy to spot
- **Labels** on sprites help identify what's what during testing
- **Health bars** appear above all characters
- **State indicators** (red/blue outlines) show creat behavior

## Testing Tips

1. **Can't see the hero?** Look for blue character with "HERO" label
2. **Where's the creat?** Look for red-orange dragon with flames, labeled "FIRE DRAKE"
3. **Finding enemies?** Red creatures with "ENEMY" or purple with "BOSS" label
4. **Looking for items?** Golden glowing objects on the ground
5. **Lost in the world?** Trees are tall green objects, grass covers the ground

## Performance Notes

- Sprites are pre-rendered at startup (fast)
- Grass tufts only render if on screen (optimization)
- Trees and bushes also culled when off-screen
- Particle effects are limited to prevent slowdown
- All sprites use alpha blending for smooth visuals

## Future Improvements

These are placeholder sprites. Future versions will have:
- Animated sprites (walking, attacking, idle)
- More detailed artwork
- Proper sprite sheets
- Multiple character/creat designs
- Biome-specific environment art
- Particle effect improvements
- Shadow effects
- Lighting system
