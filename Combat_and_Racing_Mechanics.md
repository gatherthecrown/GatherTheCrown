### Damage Calculation

```
FORMULA:
Total Damage = (Base Attack DMG × Attacker's Power Stat × Crit Multiplier × Element Bonus) - (Defender's Defense Stat × Armor Value)

EXAMPLE:
Flame Lash (25 base) × 1.2 (power) × 2.0 (crit) × 1.5 (fire vs ice) = 90 damage
Minus: Defender Defense (50) × Armor (0.8) = 40 reduction
FINAL DAMAGE: 50 HP lost
```

**Damage Types:**
- **Physical:** Reduced by armor
- **Elemental:** Reduced by resistance
- **True:** Ignores all defense (rare)
- **DOT (Damage Over Time):** Ticks every second

**Critical Hits:**
- **Chance:** 10% base (increases with stats)
- **Multiplier:** 2x damage
- **Visual:** Yellow damage numbers, screen flash
- **Sound:** Distinct "critical" sound effect
