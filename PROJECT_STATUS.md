## 🚧 Known Issues

### Design Issues (Need Resolution)
1. **Crown Durability Conflict** - Permanent vs consumable

3. **First Creat Permanence** - Limits player experimentation

### Technical Limitations
1. Pygame single-threaded (multiplayer challenging)
2. No networking built-in (need custom implementation)
3. Performance concerns for 10-player raids
4. Asset volume is AAA-scale for indie project

### Prototype Limitations
1. Placeholder graphics (colored shapes)
2. No sound effects or music
3. Limited enemy AI patterns
4. No save system yet
5. Single test biome only
