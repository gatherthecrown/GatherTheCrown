## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Python Prototype Won't Run:
```bash
# Make sure pygame is installed
pip install pygame

# Check Python version
python --version  # Should be 3.7+

# Try running from prototype folder
cd prototype
python main.py
```

### Unity Project Won't Open:
1. Check Unity version matches project
2. Let Unity import assets (first time takes a while)
3. Check console for errors

### Missing Files:
