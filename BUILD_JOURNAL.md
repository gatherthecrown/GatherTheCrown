## 2026-05-14 - Supabase Auth + Full Hero Cloud Persistence (Phase 2)

### Completed

1. Supabase Auth replaced legacy password hashing
- Replaced legacy local hash auth in [packages/server/src/utils/auth.ts](packages/server/src/utils/auth.ts)
- Signup now creates Supabase Auth user via admin API and creates matching app User row with same UUID
- Added token verification flow (`verifyToken`) and authenticated profile hydration (`getUserWithHeroes`)
- Deprecated legacy `/auth/login` endpoint in favor of Supabase session + `/auth/me`

2. Server JWT protection + ownership checks
- Updated [packages/server/src/index.ts](packages/server/src/index.ts) with:
  - Bearer JWT middleware
  - `requireAuth` route guard
  - new `/auth/me` endpoint
  - authenticated hero creation/state routes
  - ownership checks for hero read/update/delete/state routes
  - `/users/me/hero-count` endpoint for authenticated roster limit checks

3. Expanded persistence schema for full game registry mapping
- Updated [packages/server/prisma/schema.prisma](packages/server/prisma/schema.prisma) with additional User/Hero fields:
  - session-related support on User (`guestIntroCompleted`, nullable password)
  - full Hero economy/progression/homebase/creat fields
- Added Supabase SQL migration [supabase/migrations/002_hero_full_fields.sql](supabase/migrations/002_hero_full_fields.sql)
- Added User self-access RLS policies in [supabase/migrations/001_gtc_core.sql](supabase/migrations/001_gtc_core.sql)

4. Client Supabase integration + authenticated autosave
- Added Supabase client dependency to [packages/client/package.json](packages/client/package.json)
- Added client env template [packages/client/.env.example](packages/client/.env.example)
- Added [packages/client/src/utils/supabaseClient.ts](packages/client/src/utils/supabaseClient.ts)
  - Supabase client singleton
  - username -> synthetic auth email mapper
- Updated [packages/client/src/scenes/LoginScreen.ts](packages/client/src/scenes/LoginScreen.ts)
  - sign in via Supabase
  - profile hydration via `/auth/me`
- Updated [packages/client/src/scenes/CreateAccountScreen.ts](packages/client/src/scenes/CreateAccountScreen.ts)
  - account creation via `/auth/signup`
  - immediate Supabase sign-in + profile hydration
- Updated [packages/client/src/scenes/ForgeHero.ts](packages/client/src/scenes/ForgeHero.ts)
  - Bearer-protected `/users/me/hero-count`
  - Bearer-protected `/heroes/create`
- Extended [packages/client/src/registry/GameRegistry.ts](packages/client/src/registry/GameRegistry.ts)
  - token/session fields
  - `setSession`, `clearSession`
  - `hydrateFromHero`
  - debounced `scheduleSyncToServer` + `syncToServer` autosave

5. Verification
- `pnpm install` -> success
- `pnpm --filter @game/server db:generate` -> success
- `pnpm --filter @game/client build` -> success
- `pnpm --filter @game/server build` -> only pre-existing quest typing errors remain in `packages/server/src/sim/quests.ts`

### Notes
- RLS policies depend on app `User.id` matching `auth.uid()`; signup path now enforces this by writing `User.id = supabase_auth_user.id`.

## 2026-05-14 - Phase A Execution Run 2 + RC1 Test Log

### Completed

1. Netlify Phase A advanced with live preview deploy
- Netlify auth confirmed (`Dea Vinci Co.` / `GAYte Keepers`).
- Site inventory captured from `packages/client` context.
- Preview deploy succeeded using no-build workflow:
  - Draft URL: https://6a05b238cd7ed03eafd6f18c--gather-the-crown-game.netlify.app
- URL smoke confirmed page title `Gather The Crown`.

2. Production deploy smoke attempt executed
- Attempted no-build production deploy on `gather-the-crown-game`.
- Blocked by Netlify account credit cap (403: credit usage exceeded).
- Production URL check currently returns 404 Site not found.

3. First release test log file created
- Added [RELEASE_TEST_LOG_2026-05-14_RC1.md](RELEASE_TEST_LOG_2026-05-14_RC1.md)
- Captures pass/fail/blocker matrix for build, deploy, and URL smoke checks.

4. Phase A validation doc refreshed
- Updated [NETLIFY_PHASE_A_VALIDATION_2026-05-14.md](NETLIFY_PHASE_A_VALIDATION_2026-05-14.md)
- Includes monorepo CLI crash details, subfolder build-path issue, preview pass, and production blocker.

### Current Blockers

1. Netlify deploy credits exceeded (production deploy blocked).
2. Root workspace is not a git root for branch-based release validation.
3. Root-level `netlify build` monorepo selection crash on Windows CLI prompt flow.


### Netlify build command patch for monorepo compatibility
- Updated [netlify.toml](netlify.toml) build command:
  - Old: `cd packages/client && npx vite build`
  - Interim: `npx --prefix ./packages/client vite build` (subfolder Netlify build pass, root Netlify build fail: `Could not resolve entry module "index.html"`)
  - Final: `pnpm --filter @game/client build` (validated pass from both root and `packages/client`)
- Motivation: Ensures build works from both root and subfolder contexts and avoids brittle directory assumptions.
- Production retry status: still blocked by Netlify 403 account credit usage exceeded.
- Next: Restore credits, then rerun production no-build deploy smoke and remaining checklist.

### Hold-Period Task List (Low Risk)

1. Audio hook scaffolding (no asset spend)
- Add non-breaking sound event calls where actions already exist (footstep/fish/hit/pickup), keeping graceful no-audio fallback.

2. Request micro-template expansion
- Add 3-5 additional tiny Sanctuary requests reusing existing reward and rapport flow.

3. Inventory clarity
- Add visible Key/Quest item section labels and "Needed Now" tagging for tracked objectives.

4. Camera consistency pass

  - trinket errands
  - ingredient pickups
  - delivery notes
- Kept rewards small and rapport-friendly, matching the existing progression intent.
- Updated request board copy to clarify rotating delivery/request availability.

2. Inventory clarity pass (Key/Quest/Needed Now)
- Updated [packages/client/src/ui/InventoryMenu.ts](packages/client/src/ui/InventoryMenu.ts):
  - renamed quest-needs tab label to `Needed Now`
  - added explicit per-item chips for:
    - `KEY ITEM`
    - `QUEST ITEM`
    - `NEEDED NOW`

  - added clamped `setCameraZoom` helper for consistency.

- Updated [packages/client/src/scenes/HavenGrounds.ts](packages/client/src/scenes/HavenGrounds.ts):
  - added matching `1/2/3` camera preset hotkeys using the same baseline values as Town and Trail.

2. Result
- Haven, SanctuaryTrail, and SanctuaryTown now share a consistent gameplay baseline and preset model.

- Expanded on-map route writing to include Visiting Dock -> Fishers Walk -> Market Stretch -> Towne Lane -> Greenwood/Home Base pathing.

4. Haven/Forest routing updated to dock flow
- Updated direct sanctuary travel from [packages/client/src/scenes/HavenGrounds.ts](packages/client/src/scenes/HavenGrounds.ts), [packages/client/src/scenes/Haven.ts](packages/client/src/scenes/Haven.ts), and [packages/client/src/scenes/ForestZone.ts](packages/client/src/scenes/ForestZone.ts) to route through `SanctuaryIsleOverworld` instead of direct Home Base teleport.

### Chunk 8 - Sanctuary residential interiors, shift flows, and purpose-driven street errands

1. Enterable home interiors for residential clusters
- Added five enterable residential cluster doors in [packages/client/src/scenes/SanctuaryTown.ts](packages/client/src/scenes/SanctuaryTown.ts):
  - Market Cluster Homes
  - Fishers Walk Cluster
  - Hallow Cluster Homes
  - Ring Path Homes
  - Hearth Row Homes
- Pressing `E` at a home-entry marker opens an interior overlay with cluster details and current shift usage.
- Pressing `E` or `ESC` exits interior view back to town navigation.

2. Time-of-day schedule flow differences (morning / afternoon / evening)
- Added shift flow profiles in [packages/client/src/scenes/SanctuaryTown.ts](packages/client/src/scenes/SanctuaryTown.ts) to vary:
  - ambient NPC count

  - movement speed ranges
  - shift summary in HUD
- Result: morning, afternoon, and evening each now produce distinct population movement feel.

3. Street/path-bound local errands
- Expanded town request schema in [packages/client/src/scenes/SanctuaryTown.ts](packages/client/src/scenes/SanctuaryTown.ts) with:
  - `street`
  - `routeHint`
- Updated all micro-request templates to bind each errand to a named street/path (e.g., Inne Lane, Market Cross, Fishers Walk, Ring Path, Poste Walk).
- Updated request accept/reminder/pickup/completion messaging to reference route names so streets feel purpose-driven rather than decorative.

4. Town readability support
- Added street/path signage labels in [packages/client/src/scenes/SanctuaryTown.ts](packages/client/src/scenes/SanctuaryTown.ts) to reinforce route identity.

5. Validation
- Build command: `pnpm --filter @game/client build`

### Chunk 11 - Sanctuary request cadence + Needed Now tracking tune + small-screen chip readability

1. Sanctuary Town rotating request cadence pass
- Updated [packages/client/src/scenes/SanctuaryTown.ts](packages/client/src/scenes/SanctuaryTown.ts):
  - introduced request queue status (`queued`) with cadence seeding by shift profile
  - limited board visibility to a rotating pool (`visiblePool: 4`)
  - limited concurrent active requests (`maxActive: 2`)
  - auto-rotates the next queued request into availability when one is completed
  - added live board status line (`open / active / queued`) for quick cadence readability.

2. Needed Now logic narrowed to explicit active tracking flags
- Updated [packages/client/src/ui/InventoryMenu.ts](packages/client/src/ui/InventoryMenu.ts):
  - `isNeededNow` now only returns true for explicitly flagged tracked items:
    - `item.neededForQuest`
    - `item.neededForCrafting`
  - removed broad inferred inclusion from key/quest category/tag heuristics.
  - `need-quest` view now specifically filters to `neededForQuest`.

3. Quick chip/readability pass for smaller screens
- Updated [packages/client/src/ui/InventoryMenu.ts](packages/client/src/ui/InventoryMenu.ts):
  - added compact-mode sizing adjustments (`window.innerWidth <= 640`)
  - improved chip padding/font size, marker spacing, and top-row wrapping behavior
  - adjusted summary text sizing for compact view.

4. Validation
- Build command: `pnpm --filter @game/client build`
- Result: success (66 modules transformed).

### Chunk 12 - Global location shortcut standard (I / M / Shift)

1. Shared shortcut utility added
- Added [packages/client/src/utils/locationShortcuts.ts](packages/client/src/utils/locationShortcuts.ts)
- New `createLocationShortcutHandler()` centralizes location-key behavior so controls stay consistent.
- Standardized core intent:
  - `M` = map action
  - `I` = inventory action
  - `Shift` = chat action (also keeps `C` as chat alias)

2. Applied shared shortcuts across built location scenes
- Updated these scenes to use the shared shortcut handler and global key listener lifecycle:
  - [packages/client/src/scenes/Haven.ts](packages/client/src/scenes/Haven.ts)
  - [packages/client/src/scenes/HavenGrounds.ts](packages/client/src/scenes/HavenGrounds.ts)
  - [packages/client/src/scenes/ForestZone.ts](packages/client/src/scenes/ForestZone.ts)
  - [packages/client/src/scenes/SanctuaryHomeBase.ts](packages/client/src/scenes/SanctuaryHomeBase.ts)
  - [packages/client/src/scenes/VolcanoZone.ts](packages/client/src/scenes/VolcanoZone.ts)
  - [packages/client/src/scenes/SanctuaryTown.ts](packages/client/src/scenes/SanctuaryTown.ts)
  - [packages/client/src/scenes/SanctuaryTrail.ts](packages/client/src/scenes/SanctuaryTrail.ts)
  - [packages/client/src/scenes/SanctuaryIsleOverworld.ts](packages/client/src/scenes/SanctuaryIsleOverworld.ts)

### Chunk 14 - Dynamic street rotation by shift (morning/afternoon/evening)

1. Street rotation system created
- Added [packages/client/src/data/SanctuaryStreetRotations.ts](packages/client/src/data/SanctuaryStreetRotations.ts):
  - `SANCTUARY_STREETS`: Central registry of 8 streets with shift-specific purposes
  - `getStreetPurpose()`: Returns shift-aware description for any street
  - `getStreetsForShift()`: Returns all streets sorted by shift emphasis
  - `getPrimaryStreetsForShift()`: Returns top 3 emphasized streets for current shift
  
  - Morning emphasis: Fishers Walk (dock prep), Market Cross (opening), Ring Path (training)
  - Afternoon emphasis: Market Cross (peak traffic), Poste Walk (courier rush), Ring Path (drills)
  - Evening emphasis: Hearth Row (tavern crowd), Fishers Walk (quiet pier), Inne Lane (rest prep)

2. Street signage now displays shift-specific activity
- Updated [packages/client/src/scenes/SanctuaryTown.ts](packages/client/src/scenes/SanctuaryTown.ts):
  - Modified `drawStreetPathSignage()` to show street name + shift-specific purpose below
  - Each street displays what's actively happening during current shift

- Updated `getRequestCadenceOrder()`:
  - Type priorities already vary by shift (morning: ingredient→delivery→trinket, etc.)
  - NOW also sorts within types to favor emphasized streets
  - Morning peak errands pull from busy dock/market/training areas
  - Evening peak errands pull from tavern/quiet pier/rest areas

4. Impact & user experience
- Streets feel "alive" with contextual descriptions that change throughout the day
- Errand board naturally populates with location-appropriate requests
- Morning: "Gather salt reed from Fishers Walk" appears early in morning
- Evening: "Carry note to Hearth Row tavern" appears early in evening
- Path purpose updates dynamically as player traverses Sanctuary Towne across shifts

5. Validation
- Build command: `pnpm --filter @game/client build`
- Result: success (68 modules transformed).
