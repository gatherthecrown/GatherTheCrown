speed = 15;   // Faster
```

allQuests.Add(new Quest
{
    id = "my_quest",
    name = "My Quest Name",

    type = QuestType.SIDE,

    }
});
```

## 💡 Tips

### Development
- **Save Often:** Ctrl+S (Cmd+S on Mac)
- **Test Frequently:** Press Play regularly
- **Use Console:** Check for errors and debug messages
- **Version Control:** Use Git to track changes

### Performance
- **Object Pooling:** Reuse objects instead of creating new ones
- **LOD:** Use Level of Detail for distant objects
- **Occlusion Culling:** Don't render what player can't see
- **Texture Compression:** Compress textures for mobile

### Best Practices
- **Comment Your Code:** Explain what code does
- **Use Prefabs:** Create reusable game objects
- **Organize Hierarchy:** Keep scene organized
- **Name Things Clearly:** Use descriptive names
