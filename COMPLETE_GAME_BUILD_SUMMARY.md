## 📝 NOTES & CONSIDERATIONS

### What's Working Well
✅ Deep, interconnected systems  
✅ Biblical theme is unique and meaningful  
✅ Combat + Racing hybrid is innovative  
✅ Strong progression systems  
✅ Faction system adds replayability  

### Potential Challenges
⚠️ Scope is very large for solo/small team  
⚠️ Balancing combat + racing may be difficult  
⚠️ Multiplayer adds significant complexity  
⚠️ Asset creation will be time-consuming  
⚠️ Biblical theme may limit audience (or attract niche)  

### Recommendations
💡 Start with single-player MVP  
💡 Focus on core racing + combat feel first  
💡 Use asset store for initial prototyping  
💡 Consider Early Access for funding/feedback  
💡 Build community early (Discord, social media)  
💡 Prioritize 1-2 kingdoms for initial release
