- Abilities synergize with creat type:
  - Earth-affinity → Golem/Stone creats
  - Swift rogues → Air/Wind dragons
  - Water-sorcerers → Amphibious Leviathans

### Creat Bonding
- Start with baby/young creat
- Train and bond through races, trials, battles
- Creats level up independently
- Unique movesets per creat type (tremor gallop, hydroboost swim, shadow phase dash)

### Race Format
- Terrain varies: looped, linear, labyrinth-style
- Weather and elemental hazards (rain/tornado, dust/sandstorm, fire/lava flow)
- Collect items or complete objectives mid-race to qualify
- Dynamic obstacles and terrain changes
