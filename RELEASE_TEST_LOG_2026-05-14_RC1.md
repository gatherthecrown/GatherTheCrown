## Summary
- Passed: 6
- Failed: 2
- Blocked: 2

## Blockers
1. Netlify account credit usage exceeded prevents production deploy.
2. Root-folder Netlify CLI monorepo selector crash blocks normal netlify build workflow.
3. Current production URL for gather-the-crown-game resolves to Site not found.

## Recommended Immediate Fix Order
1. Restore deploy credits on Netlify account.
2. Confirm production site DNS/domain mapping for gather-the-crown-game.
3. Re-run production deploy smoke and full app route smoke.
